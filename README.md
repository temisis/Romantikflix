# recriar-Netflix
 Recreating a Netflix page with some changes as an exercise of my abilities with html and css.

 I decided to focus on making a "Romantikflix" a service dedicated to movies, series and animations that emphasize romantic relationships.

 One of the first alterations I made to signify that — besides the name — is to change the hover color from a white to a vague pink when pausing on the navbar.
