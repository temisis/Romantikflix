# Romantikflix

The iea is to create a page similar to Netflix, as an exercise of my abilities with html and css.

 I decided to focus on making a "Romantikflix" a service dedicated to movies, series and animations that emphasize romantic relationships.

 One of the first alterations I made to signify that — besides the name — is to change the color scheme and the content exhibited on the site.

 I opted for a scheme based on pinks and reds when possible, and handwritten fonts for the romantic feel of the site.

 The technologies used were JQuery (my first contact with it) to create the carousel, CSS and HTML, training my knowledge of these, putting into practice what I've already learnt, as well as how to make a responsive site.
